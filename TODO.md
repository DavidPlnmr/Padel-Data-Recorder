Non exhaustive list of things to do in the future:
- Add a way to immediately download the youtube from URL in the GUI, then it will store in any file here
- Make the keys to use indicating shots more intuitive (idk it seems so weird to me the ones used)
- Indicate who's the left and who's the right player in the GUI to get more information.
- Make a slow mo mode of the video (using a button or a key?)
- When entering an event, add the possibility to indicate what kind of shot it is :
    - Serve
    - Volley
    - Lob
    - Smash
    - Bandeja
    - Vibora (maybe in the same category as bandeja)
    - Chiquita
    - Rulo
    - Bajada
