To run the program, execute the following command:

python gui1.py

In order for the program to function correctly, you must have the PyQt5 library installed beforehand.

Once executed, a window will open.

At the bottom-left corner, there is a button that allows you to browse your files and select the video of the match you wish to visualize.

Once the video is loaded, you have the following commands at your disposal:

(1) To play/pause the video, press the 's' key.
(2) To fast forward/rewind the video by 1 minute, press the 'c/z' keys.
(3) To fast forward/rewind the video by 2 seconds, press the 'd/a' keys.
(4) To fast forward/rewind the video by 0.01 seconds, press the 'e/q' keys.

At the top-right corner, in the fields labeled "Team 1" and "Team 2," enter the names of the teams participating in the match you are visualizing.

To start the visualization, press the "Start" button.

Before the rally begins, indicate which team is serving.

To keep track of the number of shots, we suggest pausing the video whenever a player executes a shot, and then pressing the 'j' key to indicate that a shot has been made.

If you make a mistake, you can remove the last entry using the "Remove last event" button.

Once the rally is finished, stop the video and indicate the winning team by pressing the corresponding button at the bottom-right corner.

Proceed to the next rally.
